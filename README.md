This repo contains the code that is used for a POC of automating the process of documentations 


# api_docs.html
“As part of our CI workflow, after every build, Jenkins auto-generates a clear HTML documentation file for our APIs.”

“This web-based doc lists every endpoint, the main functionality, modules (like Flask and requests) and highlights areas such as error handling and edge cases.”

“It helps all stakeholders—developers, managers, testers—instantly understand what our API does, and (if needed) onboard faster.”

“No more manual documentation—our process ensures docs are as fresh as our latest release.”
